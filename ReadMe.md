# Fox Hound AZ/EL Antenna Rotator Project

## Description
	* I wanted to create my own az/el rotator system for tracking satellites and other objects for
	radio. This project uses arduino as the microcontroller and will use the raspberry pi to act as
	a server for gpredict over the network. The pi will also pass rtl_sdr packets to the desktop for 
	decoding data. Keeping the reciever as close to my antennas as possible.
	
## Install
	 *TODO: WILL BE UPDATED
	 
## Hardware
	*Circuits and setup in the docs folder.
